<span class="person">Amy Hodge</span> is the Science Data Librarian for Stanford University Libraries, where, among other things, she provides Carpentries training to groups all over campus. Amy received a PhD from Yale in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and spent her pre-library career working for science database companies and learning the beauty of SQL. She prefers enabling others to do better science rather than doing science herself. She quilts and knits and cooks, and last fall she turned one wall of her bedroom into a giant paint-by-number mural (<a href="http://www.amyalamode.com/blog/2016/10/02/wall-sized-paint-by-number/">http://www.amyalamode.com/blog/2016/10/02/wall-sized-paint-by-number/</a>) </p>
